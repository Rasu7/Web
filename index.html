        <p> We have found that the Brownian motion of nanoparticles at the molecular and nanoscale level is a key mechanism governing the thermal behavior of nanoparticle–fluid suspensions (“nanofluids”). We have devised a theoretical model that accounts for the fundamental role of dynamic nanoparticles in nanofluids. The model not only captures the concentration and temperature-dependent conductivity, but also predicts strongly size-dependent conductivity. Furthermore, we have discovered a fundamental difference between solid/solid composites and solid/liquid suspensions in size-dependent conductivity. This understanding could lead to design of nanoengineered next-generation coolants with industrial and biomedical applications in high-heat-flux cooling. &copy; <b>2004 American Institute of Physics.</b>

        <h1>What Our Client Think!</h1>
        <p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of typ e and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p> <br>
